Holidays For The Heroes Hero Description Maker

Summary: A program that can take in a csv file or inputs to generate
hero descriptions for each hero in the gallery on the website.

Author: Kurt Campbell
Date: 20 November 2021
Version: 1.6

Modifications:
    2022-01-04 - Added condition statements within holiday_filler method
    2022-01-06 - Implemented method for how the mission should be printed
    2022-08-23 - Removed the mission sentence since stating the mission in an
                 hero's statement is unnecessary. Therefore, the mission filler
                 method, variables that store the hero's mission
                 number and sentence, and mission count from csv option has been
                 removed.

                 Added space between the Navy and Coast Guard within the branch prompt
                 when user enters the information manually.
